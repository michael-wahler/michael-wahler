I am a [Senior Lecturer and Researcher in Software Engineering](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/person/wahl/) at Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW).

Here on github.com I am sharing two kinds of projects:
- Private projects that are actually useful for very few people (such as [data acquisition for a battery charger](https://github.com/michael-wahler/CM2016)) or where I am playing around with technology (such as [AI speaker recognition](https://github.com/michael-wahler/whos-talking)).
- Projects related to my research where I share executable artifacts.
